# thesis-lgd-climate-risk
My thesis consists of Monte Carlo simulation and machine learning (Random Forest, XGBoost) to estimate Loss Given Default (LGD) for Greek mortgage loans under climate and physical risks (flood, fire, earthquake).
Working on this thesis was both challenging and rewarding.  
Because climate-adjusted LGD estimation is a new area with very little 
existing research, there were no ready-made solutions to follow.  

I often had to think through the problems from scratch â€” whether it was 
how to design the Monte Carlo simulation, how to build realistic synthetic 
datasets, or how to adapt machine learning models for this purpose.  

It took a lot of trial, error, and persistence, but in the end the process 
helped me grow as an independent problem-solver and led to the proposal of 
a stress-testing framework that I believe could open the path to integrate natural risks in Greek banks' portfolios.
The datasets of natural risks and properties can be found inside the thesis references. I uploaded some of the final datasets and examples of the natural risk data as a sample.
This is my final work for the time being.
